# U-Net Implementation for Image Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of the U-Net architecture, a well-known deep learning model for image segmentation tasks. The code is structured to read images and their corresponding masks, preprocess them, train a U-Net model, and visualize the results.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed to run the code:

- Python 3.8+
- Tensorflow 2.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Install all the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python-headless matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone [Your Repository Link]
cd [Your Repository Name]
```

2. **Run the provided code**:
Replace `[Your Code File].py` with the name of the main script.

```bash
python [Your Code File].py
```

3. Visualize the results in the generated plots.

## Model Architecture

This implementation uses the U-Net architecture. U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg, Germany. The network is based on the fully convolutional network and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations.

## Results

The trained model segments the images based on the masks provided. Different thresholds can be set to analyze the segmentation results. The code visualizes and compares the original image, U-Net predictions, and the ground truth masks.
